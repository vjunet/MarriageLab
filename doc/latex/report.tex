\section{Abstract}

Online dating or match-making websites are flourishing these days. More and more people rely on their algorithms when searching for their Mr. Right, or Mrs. Right, respectively. Algorithms for match-making are therefore of quite some interest.

%TODO

The goal of this paper is to discuss the original model described by \citet{1962} and advance the model in some sense. Namely we are going to introduce two changes to the model:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item In the original model every node knows all the other nodes of the opposite gender. In a setting like a database of some match-making site this may be true. But as soon as the number of nodes gets big, it costs a huge amount of computation time to consider all nodes. In reality, information about the nodes of opposite is never complete (this would mean knowing about 3.5 billion people).
  \item It is also conceivable that at some point a node might change its opinion about other nodes and rearrange them in his preference rating
\end{enumerate}

It is however not our claim that these changes applied to the model will make it an exact description of reality. Our goal is to study the repercussions on the stability and other significant indicators that show up when applying the modifications.
