## General Introduction

The stability problem is an interesting mathematical problem and we’re inclined in analysing it a bit further. This algorithm can be used in the college admission and, obviously, to match people according to their preferences. This problem was studied by Gale and Shapley in 1962 in an economical context about stability. They developed an algorithm which always finds the best possible stability state.

## The Model

We want to reproduce the algorithm about the stability problem with some modifications. These would be: the people wouldn’t have complete information about the other, meaning they don’t necessarily know each other; they can also change their preferences (mind) during the process. This model is more likely to be observed in everyday life.

## Fundamental Questions

The original algorithm always ends up in a stable state, we would like to observe what would be the repercussions on the stability with the changes, as above described. How many instable couple are there once the algorithm terminates? (According to the definition of stability in the paper from Shapley and Gale.)
How does the lack of information correspond to the stability? How is the frequency of the preference changes related to the stability?



## Expected Results

We expect the following results:
> * The algorithm wouldn’t be stable anymore.
> * The lack of information would lead to a more or less stable state but with some people without partner.
> * The preference changes would almost always lead to an unstable state.
