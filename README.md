> * Group Name: (be creative!)
> * Group participants names: Samuel Imfeld, Valentin Junet
> * Project Title: Stable Marriage Problem

## General Introduction

The stability problem is an interesting mathematical problem and we’re inclined in analysing it a bit further. This algorithm can be used in the college admission and, obviously, to match people according to their preferences. This problem was studied by Gale and Shapley in 1962 in an economical context about stability. They developed an algorithm which always finds the best possible stability state.

## The Model

We want to reproduce the algorithm about the stability problem with some modifications. These would be: the people wouldn’t have complete information about the other, meaning they don’t necessarily know each other; they can also change their preferences (mind) during the process. This model is more likely to be observed in everyday life.

## Fundamental Questions

(At the end of the project you want to find the answer to these questions)
(Formulate a few, clear questions. Articulate them in sub-questions, from the more general to the more specific. )


## Expected Results

(What are the answers to the above questions that you expect to find before starting your research?)
